An introductory project on computer security, Snow Crash aims to introduce security in different sub-domains, with a developer-oriented approach. We will familiarize ourselves with several languages ​​(ASM / perl / php ..), develop a certain logic to understand unknown programs, and thus become aware of the problems related to simple "errors" programming.
